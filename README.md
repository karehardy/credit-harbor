# Credit Harbor Marketplace

## Introduction
Credit Harbor is a two-way marketplace developed by **Nature Wired** to connect corporate buyers with verified carbon and biodiversity credits from high-impact nature-based projects.  Built on **Bubble.io**, a no-code platform, Credit Harbor simplifies the process of discovering, verifying, and transacting environmental credits. In the initial phase, we have built an MVP web application that can facilitate project discovery and connection, with manual curation from the Nature Wired admin team.
